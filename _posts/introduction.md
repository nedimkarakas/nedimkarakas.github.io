## Introduction / meet the contenders 

Have you ever wondered who is better at predicting football matches? 
Hardcore superfans, statistics, casual viewers or cute puppies?

First up we have yours truly, representing the category of the hardcore football fans. 

I've been a football fan for as long as I can remember and in addition to that I'm also a huge nerd - to which my 10 years of playing Football Manager can testify. 

 **For the unitiated:** *Football Manager is basically more of a glorified spreadsheet than an actual video game.*

I'll be giving my predictions based on my intiution and knowledge and understanding of the game - 
in short I'll be your classic TV pundit meaning *very* biased and mostly bullshit. **#Deutschland #Meister #5sterne**

As you may have noticed from the page, I'm really into data science and therefore I've decided to put my skills to a test and throw together a quick **P**ile **O**f **P**oorly **U**nderstood **L**inear **A**lgebra to predict the games.

 The model was trained on data from the past World Cup held in Brazil with a little flair of Football Manager player attribute values added in just for fun. I've painstakingly assembled all the datasets myself. Fun fact - both Google and Microsoft have been doing similiar things in 2014 and had a really good run at predicting the K.O. stage of the tournament. 

**Disclamer:** *If you're unsure how good the FM database is just know that a fair number of major clubs use it as a scouting tool*


More on the technical stuff can be found at **Projects**.

I love her to bits, but the fact that she is a Chelsea supporter is enough to discredit her as a pundit, decision maker and human being - but she also chose me, through which she has more than redeemed herself. 

That being said this lovely ray of sunshine representing the category of the casual football fan is either terribly wrong or spectaculary right. She also promised to root for Germany because well... I can't make her support Man United, so we compromised. 


### <img src = /Users/nedimkarakas/nedimkarakas.github.io/assets/images/jimmie.png style = "width:150px; height:150px"> JIMMIE a.k.a "THE DOGGO ORACLE"

Following in the footsteps of the great Paul The Octopus (God bless his soul) this 10 year old Pekingnese/Lhasa Apso mix puppy will try to predict the outcomes of the matches by choosing one of two treats, with each one corresponding to one of the teams involved in a particular fixture. 

Jimmie is also a big football fan and an excellent goalkeeper with rushing out skills that would put Manuel Neuer to shame.
